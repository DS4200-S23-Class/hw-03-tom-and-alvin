                    <!--Lists the row information-->
                    <li>Area:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The number of electoral votes bar</li>
                        <li>The map of the United States of America</li>  
                        <li>The 5 electoral votes for Nebraska</li> 
                        <li>The 4 electoral votes for Maine</li> 
                    </ul>
                    <li>Point:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The number of electoral votes needed to win the election</li>

            <h3>Channels</h3>
                <ul>
                    <!--Lists the row information-->
                    <li>Color:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is a great channel to distinguish the states. The color red represents the Republican party while blue represents the Democratic party.</li> 
                        <li>This is a good mapping because these two colors both pop out and you can easily tell the difference at a quick glance between the two. Also, the color association of red and blue is widely known across the country so it is easy to correlate the color with the party without a map. This is used in the map, the electoral vote line, and the electoral votes for Nebraska and Maine.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <!--Lists the column information-->
                    <li>Shape:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The different shapes in this map respresent the states of the United States. </li>
                        <li>This is good mapping because the map of the United States is known to Americans all over the country. People are easily able to see which states voted for which political party.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li>Position (Horizontal):</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The horizontal line at the top of this chart represents the number of electoral votes each candidate has gotten.</li>
                        <li>This is good mapping because it shows the halfway point (the point listed above) and you easily tell who is winning in the election very quickly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The two colors (red and blue) are quite distinct. Red is used to represent the Republican party and blue is used to represent the Democratic party.</li>
                        <li>This is good mapping because it is easy for viewers to see which parts on the chart correlate to which political</li>

                    <!--Lists the row information-->
                    <li>Point:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Points on the graph representing the exit velocity and launch angles of batted balls</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Lines:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Denote the type of hit that the batter played. There are lines denoting fly balls, line drives, pop-ups and ground-balls </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

            <h3>Channels</h3>
                <ul>
                    <!--Lists the row information-->
                    <li>Horizontal and vertical position:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The positioning of each point on the graph gives the viewer an idea of the velocity and launch angles of each batted ball. </li> 
                        <li>This channel represents the velocity and launch angles and it is a great choice to display how to visualise the information as it gives the user a good idea of which balls had a low velocity and a low launch angle, and vice versa. </li>
                    </ul>

                    <!--Lists the column information-->
                    <li>Color - Hue:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The scoring value of each batted ball is depicted by color on this visualization. Those that are below average have a purple-ish collar, those at the average have a white color, and those above the average have an orange color.  </li>
                        <li> I think this is a good representation of the scoring value attribute, as the user is clearly able to visualise what angles and velocities generate the most points, which ones generate average points, and which ones generate below average points.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li>Color - Luminance:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To represent how far away from the average each point is, the author of this visual decided to incorporate a luminance element. The further away from the average the point was, the darker the point got.</li>
                        <li>I think this is a good mapping because the viewer can easily understand that darker values mean more, so the more intense the color was the further away it was from the average. </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <h3>Color Map</h3>

                    <!--Lists the row information-->
                    <li>Divergent:</li> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>The purple, white, and blue color maps represent the scoring value of each batted ball. 
                        </li>
                        <li>The divergent color map used by this visualization is a good choice as it uses two colors (blue and purple) to indicate the extremes of a range, and neutral white color in the middle.  </li>
